#' @details Currently the Sunlight Labs API provides two methods for obtaining
#'    information about legislators: sll_cg_getlegislator and
#'    sll_cg_getlegislatorlist. Both of these methods operate in essentially
#'    the same way, the main difference being that sll_cg_getlegislator returns
#'    a single legislator (or an error if the query would have resulted in
#'    multiple legislators) and sll_cg_getlegislatorlist returns a list of
#'    legislators (a list of size one is allowed). In other words,
#'    sll_cg_getlegislator is purely a convenience method to avoid dealing with
#'    a list of values when only one value is needed.
#'
#' All social media account values can be turned into URLs by preceding them with the domain name 
#' of the service in question:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item http://twitter.com/[username]
#'  \item http://youtube.com/[username or channel ID]
#'  \item http://facebook.com/[username or ID]
#' }

#' \bold{Note about zip codes from Sunlight Foundation (a direct quote):} "A zip code may intersect 
#' multiple Congressional districts, so locating by 
#' zip may return multiple representatives, and possibly more than 2 senators if the zip code 
#' crosses state borders. In general, we recommend against using zip codes to look up members of 
#' Congress. For one, itâ€™s imprecise: a zip code can intersect multiple congressional districts. 
#' More importantly, zip codes are not shapes. They are lines (delivery routes), and treating them 
#' as shapes leads to inaccuracies."
